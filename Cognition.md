### Cognition Model for Lineups with Direct Annotation 


1.	Visual Input (lineup)

Stimuli: Participant sees a lineup of similar scatterplots.
Goal: Identify the one plot that is statistically most different (e.g., strongest trend).



2.	Visual encoding and perception

Bottom-up attention

Participants initially scan the lineup using low-effort, fast perceptual mechanisms. Visual salience such as contrast, clustering, or outliers - guides attention automatically toward certain plots. (Padilla et al., 2018) 


3.	Schema activation and matching (A schema is a mental model or learned pattern that helps us recognize and interpret information quickly.)


Participants match what they see in each plot with stored mental templates or schemas. This matching is fast if the schema fits well.

If the plot encoding is unfamiliar or contradicts these schemas, cognitive transformations are required to align what they see with what they expect (eg. mentally rotating or flipping the graph, Re-scaling axes or adjusting expectations) 



4.	Cognitive Processing

Spatial Reasoning Path (Type 1- fast, intuitive)

Participant mentally aligns plots, estimates slope visually, or marks clusters of points. 
Uses spatial working memory to compare patterns across plots.

(Trickett & Trafton, 2006)




Numerical/Analytical Reasoning Path (Type 2- Slow, Deliberative)

Participant mentally estimates slopes or variance.
Applies domain knowledge, Uses verbal working memory and abstract inference.

(Padilla et al., 2018; Freedman & Shah, 2002)


5.	Decision making and Annotation

Participant selects the plot and annotates their reasoning.

The nature of their annotation (spatial vs. conceptual) reveals: The strategy they used, the type of uncertainty involved (spatial vs. numerical), the potential source of error propagation.
