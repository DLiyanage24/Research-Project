### Cognition Model for Lineups with Direct Annotation

#### 1. Visual Input (lineup)

Stimuli: Participant sees a lineup of similar scatterplots.\
Goal: Identify the one plot that is statistically most different (e.g., strongest trend).

#### 2. Visual encoding and perception

Bottom-up attention.

Participants initially scan the lineup using low-effort, fast perceptual mechanisms. Visual salience such as contrast, clustering, or outliers - guides attention automatically toward certain plots. (Padilla et al., 2018)

#### 3. Schema activation and matching

Participants match what they see in each plot with stored mental templates or schema.

#### 4. Cognitive Processing

Once the participant has scanned the lineup and activated relevant schema, they must decide how to interpret and judge the differences among the plots. This decision often happens implicitly and may depends on task complexity, perceived difficulty, graph clarity, individual differences etc.

**Spatial Reasoning Path (Type 1- fast, intuitive)**

Some participant mentally aligns plots, estimates slope visually. Uses spatial working memory to compare patterns across plots.(Trickett & Trafton, 2006).

**Numerical/Analytical Reasoning Path (Type 2- Slow, Deliberative)**

Some participant mentally estimates slopes or variance. These participants do not rely on visual features alone. Applies domain knowledge and uses verbal working memory and abstract inference. (Padilla et al., 2018; Freedman & Shah, 2002).

Q - Can people use both these paths and make a decision
(Dual Process Theory) 


#### 5. Decision making and Annotation

Participant selects the plot and annotates their reasoning.\
Participants who use the spatial reasoning path may tend to annotate by marking visual features like circles, arrows. Participants who use the numerical reasoning path may annotate with text labels, descriptive notes.

The nature of their annotation reveals: The strategy they used, the type of uncertainty involved (spatial vs. numerical), the potential source of error propagation.
