Create a framework for comprehensive testing across multiple levels of user engagement - by combining multiple methods of user testing within the same experiment, we can gather information that spans multiple levels of engagement with acceptably small impact on participant cognitive load.

**Augmentation of statistical lineup:**

eg. - examine whether there is value in adding contextual information (axis scales, labels, titles), expanding lineups beyond basic perception and grouping.

eg. - combining lineups with direct annotation: establishing whether there is added value in including direct interaction with lineups in online visual inference studies.

**Augmenting Single-Plot Studies:**

eg. -  combine numerical estimation, and direct annotation.

eg. - examine the over- lap between direct annotation and think-aloud protocols using an online platform. 

eg. - add forced-choice questions to the battery of methods for examining graphics, examining numerical estimation, forced-choice questions, and open-ended responses, with the potential to include or substitute the use of direct annotation or think-aloud methods based on the results of previous experiments.
