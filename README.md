Create a framework for comprehensive testing across multiple levels of user engagement - by combining multiple methods of user testing within the same experiment, we can gather information that spans multiple levels of engagement with acceptably small impact on participant cognitive load.

**Augmentation of statistical lineup:**

eg. - examine whether there is value in adding contextual information (axis scales, labels, titles), expanding lineups beyond basic perception and grouping.

eg. - combining lineups with direct annotation, lineups with talk-aloud protocal

**Augmenting Single-Plot Studies:**

eg. -  combine numerical estimation, direct annotation , think-aloud or add forced-choice questions
