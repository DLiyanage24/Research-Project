## Create a framework for comprehensive testing across multiple levels of user engagement

Current methods of assessing graphics using measures like accuracy or speed, misses how users actually engage with charts. There are different ways to evaluate visualizations based on user tasks, but do not test multiple methods on the same charts. This proposed work aims to fill that gap by testing the same charts using multiple methods with the same participants, data and testing conditions. This helps us get a clearer, more complete understanding of how chart design affects user experience.

By combining multiple methods of user testing within the same experiment, we can gather information that spans multiple levels of engagement with acceptably small impact on participant cognitive load.

**Augmentation of statistical lineup:**

eg. - combining lineups with direct annotation, lineups with talk-aloud protocol

**Augmenting single-plot studies:**

eg. - combine numerical estimation, direct annotation , think-aloud or add forced-choice questions

### Last week( 10 July - 16 July)

-   Read research papers related to cognition and perception in graph comprehension. Read and summarized research papers, including:

    -   **Shah, P. (2002). A Model of the Cognitive and Perceptual Processes in Graphical Display Comprehension.**
        -   Demonstrates that graph comprehension involves a combination of bottom-up perceptual processes, top-down cognitive factors, individual differences, and a serial, incremental interpretation process.
    -   **Shah, P., & Freedman, E. G. (2009). Bar and line graph comprehension: An interaction of top-down and bottom-up processes.**
        -   Establishes that that an individual’s interpretation a bar or line graph is a function of the format, the viewer’s familiarity with the content depicted in a graph, and the viewer’s graphicacy skills.
    -   **Tory, M., & Möller, T. (2004). Human factors in visualization research.** ***IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 10(1), 72–84.***
        -   Reviews methodologies from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that can be applied to visualization research, reviews human factors contributions in visualization and identify key directions for future work.

-   Started going through the book - R packages(Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan)

    -   Completed the reading of creating a toy R package and gained an idea about the general workflow for package development with devtools.

### To do list for the next week

-   Begin exploring interactive data visualization with D3.js
-   Continue following the R packages book.
