## Create a framework for comprehensive testing across multiple levels of user engagement

Current methods of assessing graphics using measures like accuracy or speed, misses how users actually engage with charts. There are different ways to evaluate visualizations based on user tasks, but do not test multiple methods on the same charts. This proposed work aims to fill that gap by testing the same charts using multiple methods with the same participants, data and testing conditions. This helps us get a clearer, more complete understanding of how chart design affects user experience.

By combining multiple methods of user testing within the same experiment, we can gather information that spans multiple levels of engagement with acceptably small impact on participant cognitive load.

**Augmentation of statistical lineup:**

eg. - combining lineups with direct annotation, lineups with talk-aloud protocol

**Augmenting single-plot studies:**

eg. - combine numerical estimation, direct annotation , think-aloud or add forced-choice questions

### Last week( 23 July - 30 July)

-   Explored D3 (JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers)
    -   Followed Chapters 1–8 of the book ***Interactive Data Visualization for the Web by Scott Murray.***
    -   Gained a basic understanding of D3 concepts, technology fundamentals including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, and SVG.
    -   Figured out how to setup D3 and create basic visualizations including setting up a local web server, linking D3 scripts and using browser developer tools to inspect and debug.
-   Investigated “You Draw It” implementation.
    -   Reviewed Emily's setup for the “You Draw It” implementation.
    -   Conducted an initial test by simulating sample data in R, using D3 to render lineup plots, connecting R and JavaScript through the 'r2d3' package with shiny binding.

### To do list for the next week

-   Explore how to incorporate interactivity, including tracking the user’s mouse movements and annotation features.
-   Continue progressing through the ***Interactive Data Visualization for the Web*** book beyond Chapter 8.
