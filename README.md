## Create a framework for comprehensive testing across multiple levels of user engagement

Current methods of assessing graphics using measures like accuracy or speed, misses how users actually engage with charts. There are different ways to evaluate visualizations based on user tasks, but do not test multiple methods on the same charts. This proposed work aims to fill that gap by testing the same charts using multiple methods with the same participants, data and testing conditions. This helps us get a clearer, more complete understanding of how chart design affects user experience.

By combining multiple methods of user testing within the same experiment, we can gather information that spans multiple levels of engagement with acceptably small impact on participant cognitive load.

**Augmentation of statistical lineup:**

eg. - combining lineups with direct annotation, lineups with talk-aloud protocal

**Augmenting single-plot studies:**

eg. - combine numerical estimation, direct annotation , think-aloud or add forced-choice questions

### Last week

-   Explored cognitive processes involved in graph comprehension. Read and summarized research papers, including:

    -   Trickett & Trafton (2006) on the role of spatial processing in graph comprehension.
    -   Padilla et al.(2018) on a dual-process cognitive model for decision-making with visualizations, incorporating both fast (Type 1) and deliberative (Type 2) reasoning.
    -   Shah, P., Freedman, E. G., & Vekiri, I. (2005). The Comprehension of Quantitative Information in Graphical Displays.
    -   Robinson et al. (2022) - You Draw Itâ€™: Implementation of Visually Fitted Trends with r2d3 
    

-   Drafted a cognitive model for lineups with direct annotation

    -   Drafted a model outlining how users interpret and annotate statistical lineups, integrating both spatial uncertainity and numerical uncertainty.

### To do list for the next week

-   Continue reading research papers regarding cognition
-   Continue reviewing literature on comprehensive testing across multiple levels of user engagement
